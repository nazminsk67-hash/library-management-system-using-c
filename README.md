The Library Management System using C is a console-based application designed to automate the daily operations of a library, such as maintaining book records, user details, and transaction history. It allows the librarian to add new books, update existing records, search for books by title or author, and remove outdated entries, making library management more organized and efficient.

The system supports issuing and returning books by maintaining information about borrowers, issue dates, and return dates. This helps in tracking book availability, avoiding duplication, and reducing manual errors that commonly occur in traditional record-keeping methods.

File handling concepts in C are used to store all data permanently in files, ensuring that library information is preserved even after the program is closed. This enables quick retrieval of records whenever required and makes the system reliable for long-term use.
